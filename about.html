<div class="about-content">
<p>According to <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/celiac-disease" target="_blank">Johns Hopkins*</a>, over 2 million people in the United States have been diagnosed with celiac disease. In 2021, our founder Kiren, became one of those 2 million. She saught support from various groups, and found that an alarming percentage of those with gluten sensitivities did not have access to fun treats. Having to abstain from food is hard enough as is, Kiren wanted to make the lives of fellow sufferers easier and thus our subscription service was founded.</p>
<p>We hope to provide you with a delicious, inclusive experience!</p>
